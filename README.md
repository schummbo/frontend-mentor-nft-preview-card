### What I learned

More testing my previous skills. I used a little flexbox stuff this time. I feel like the CSS could be refactored. Seemed like a lot to get a fairly simple thing done.

### Continued development

Still hoping to learn more flexbox and CSS grid. It isn't perfect but I'm feeling fairly pleased with how these little challenges are turning out.
